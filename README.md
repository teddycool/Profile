Fetching and using profile information.

Project from ScaniaHack 2016. Demonstrator of how profileinformation from intranet can be presented. 
Two fuctions: 
'Who is calling?' 
'How to contact?'  
Look-up of information for  people/departments. No working dataconnection since ScaniaHack is ended...
However, the principle and the mechanisms can be used in other projects.
